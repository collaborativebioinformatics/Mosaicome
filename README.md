### 🎯 **Mission Statement**

Our primary objective is to build and validate a high-performance **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to classify structural variations (SVs) from genomic data. We aim to create a robust, reproducible, and well-documented solution that can accurately identify complex genomic rearrangements.

### ✨ **Contribution Guidelines**

To ensure smooth collaboration, we will adhere to the following workflow.

1.  **Branching:** Create a new branch for each new feature or fix (`feature/name` or `fix/issue`). Do not commit directly to `main`.
2.  **Pull Requests:** Submit a Pull Request (PR) for review when your work is complete.
3.  **Code Review:** At least one other team member must review and approve a PR before it can be merged.
4.  **Issue Tracking:** Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or track tasks.
